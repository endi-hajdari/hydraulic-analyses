# Hydraulic Analyses
This repository contains **7 different projects** related to wastewater treatment processes, hydraulic and hydrological modelling of various structures/systems of different scales, as well as the design and analysis of municipal hydraulic systems. Each of these projects were affliated with my undergraduate studies in Civil Engineering at McMaster University and/or my research experiences.
